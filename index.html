          Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
          traits and manifests in various forms. Formal education occurs within
          a structured institutional framework, such as public schools,
          following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured
          approach but occurs outside the formal schooling system, while
          informal education entails unstructured learning through daily
          experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into
          levels, including early childhood education, primary education,
          secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications
          focus on teaching methods, such as teacher-centered and
          student-centered education, and on subjects, such as science
          education, language education, and physical education. Additionally,
          the term "education" can denote the mental states and qualities of
          educated individuals and the academic field studying educational
          phenomena.

          Education in India has much room for growth, such as improving access
          to education, increasing the quality of education,[9] reducing
          disparities, lowering dropout rates, increasing enrolment and
          completion rates,[10] enhancing learning outcomes and employability,
          strengthening governance and accountability, promoting innovation and
          technology, and addressing the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. It is
          influenced by various policies and programmes at the national and
          state levels, such as the National Education Policy 2020, the Samagra
          Shiksha Abhiyan, the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the Midday
          Meal Scheme, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme, and the National
          Digital Education Architecture. It is also supported by various
          stakeholders and partners, such as UNICEF, UNESCO, World Bank, civil
          society organisations, academic institutions, private sector entities,
          and media outlets.

          From the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis was to develop
          a pool of scientifically inclined manpower.[115] India's National
          Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation
          and development of higher technical education, which came into being
          as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1987
          through an act of the Indian parliament.[116] At the central level,
          the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space
          Science and Technology, the National Institutes of Technology and the
          Indian Institutes of Information Technology are deemed of national
          importance.[116]
